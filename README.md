                                                   Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
   
This project addresses the problem of sentiment analysis in twitter, that is classifying tweets according to the sentiment expressed in them. Due to large amount of usage we hope to achieve a reflection of public sentiment by analyzing the sentiments expressed in the tweets. Analyzing the public sentiment is important for many applications such as firms trying to find out the response of their products in the market. The aim of this project is to develop a functional classifier for accurate and automatic sentiment classification of an unknown tweet stream.


Advantages:
->Proposed system will gives you the freedom to choose the data of any topic.
->It gives you the impact the results and statistics will have on the respective field.
->Proposed system  allows retrieval of data based on the query entered by the user.
->Proposed system will provide accurate feature selection. 

Existing system:
The Existing work mainly focuses on classifying user into binary sentiment(i.e positive, negative) and they do not go further in mining user sentiment.
The Existing approaches mainly leverage product category information or  tag information to study the interpersonal influence.
User reviews can provide us ideas in mining interpersonal interference and user preferences.
